# Obsidian-Graphics-Engine

The Obsidian Graphics Engine is a C++ OpenGL based PBR Graphics Demo personal project where I test and implement lighting techniques. 
The base architecture of the engine is simple and designed to make implementings different graphics techniques easy. 
There is a GUI creates using ImGUI to edit the scene and view parts of the rendering pipeline such as various intermediate buffers like depth and normals.
